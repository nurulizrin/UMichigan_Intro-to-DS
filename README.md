# Introduction-to-Data-Science-with-Python
Based on UMichigan's coursera Intro to DS with Python course.

Note: 
Repository only includes source files and solutions for Week 2 to Week 4 assignments; Week 1 was a quiz. You can easily find Week 2-3 solutions online. Week 4 is definitely more difficult for a Py beginner.

<b>Why I'm giving out answers?</b><br>
I've found reading through other people's work a lot of help. Unfortunately, whatever I found was not helpful, not commented on, or straight-up just the answers and no "shown work". I wrote my code to be as pandorable as possible, and commented more on the t-test function for Week 4. 

Hope this helps!
